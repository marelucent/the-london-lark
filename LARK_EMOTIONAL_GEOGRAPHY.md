# 🕊️ The Lark's Emotional Geography

*How she thinks about connection, adjacency, and what you actually need*

---

## Three Systems, One Heart

The Lark uses three overlapping systems to understand what door to offer you:

| System | Question it answers |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Voice Families** | *How should I speak to you?* |
| **Tarot Adjacency** | *What's nearby the door you asked for?* |
| **Shared Need Clusters** | *What do you actually need right now?* |

They work together. They're not the same thing.

---

## 1. Voice Families — How She Speaks

Eight voices, each with its own energy. The arcana you land in determines how she greets you.

| Family | Energy | Arcana |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **MYTHIC** | Ancient, ritualistic, veiled | Witchy & Wild, Spiritual, Grief & Grace, Contemplative |
| **VELVET** | Seductive, glamorous, winking | Cabaret & Glitter, Late-Night, Nostalgic, Romanticised London |
| **WILD** | Urgent, electric, transformative | Big Night Out, Punchy/Protest, Queer Revelry, Group Energy |
| **TENDER** | Warm, soft, inclusive | Folk & Intimate, Comic Relief, Wonder & Awe |
| **CURIOUS** | Playful, strange, experimental | Playful & Weird, Curious Encounters, Body-Based |
| **SHARP** | Precise, intellectual, burning | Thoughtful Stage, Rant & Rapture, Word & Voice |
| **GLOBAL** | Rhythmic, expansive, connected | Global Rhythms, Melancholic Beauty |
| **HOLDING** | Gentle, present, unhurried | Care Tiers 2 & 3, Null State |

**Example:** You search "witchy" → she speaks in MYTHIC voice → *"The veil is thin tonight. Can you feel it?"*

---

## 2. Tarot Adjacency — What's Nearby

Each arcana has neighbours — not by category, but by emotional resonance. Where one card might naturally lead.

| Arcana | Card | Neighbours |
|--------|------|------------|
| Playful & Weird | 0 – The Fool | The Magician, The Lovers, The Chariot |
| Curious Encounters | I – The Magician | The Fool, Temperance, Justice |
| Witchy & Wild | II – High Priestess | The Moon, Death, The Hierophant |
| Folk & Intimate | III – The Empress | The Hermit, Judgement, Temperance |
| Thoughtful Stage | IV – The Emperor | Justice, The Magician, The Hierophant |
| Spiritual / Sacred | V – The Hierophant | The High Priestess, The Emperor, The Star |
| Cabaret & Glitter | VI – The Lovers | The Fool, The Sun, The Empress |
| Big Night Out | VII – The Chariot | The Fool, The Lovers, The Devil |
| Punchy / Protest | VIII – Strength | Justice, The Hanged Man, The Tower |
| Contemplative | IX – The Hermit | Death, The Empress, The Moon |
| Global Rhythms | X – Wheel of Fortune | The Star, Judgement, Temperance |
| Rant & Rapture | XI – Justice | Strength, The Emperor, The Magician |
| Body-Based | XII – The Hanged Man | Death, Strength, The Tower |
| Grief & Grace | XIII – Death | The Hermit, The Hanged Man, The Moon |
| Word & Voice | XIV – Temperance | The Empress, The Magician, Wheel of Fortune |
| Late-Night Lark | XV – The Devil | The Chariot, The Tower, The Lovers |
| Melancholic Beauty | XVI – The Tower | The Devil, Death, The Hanged Man |
| Wonder & Awe | XVII – The Star | The Moon, Wheel, The Hierophant |
| Nostalgic / Vintage | XVIII – The Moon | The Star, Death, High Priestess |
| Comic Relief | XIX – The Sun | The Lovers, Judgement, The Fool |
| Group Energy | XX – Judgement | The Empress, The Sun, Wheel of Fortune |
| Queer Revelry | XXI – The World | The Sun, Judgement, The Chariot |
| Romanticised London | ✦ – The Lark | The Star, The World, The Fool |

**Example:** You search "witchy" (High Priestess) → adjacent cards are The Moon (Nostalgic), Death (Grief & Grace), The Hierophant (Spiritual)

## 3. Shared Need Clusters — What You Actually Need

Sometimes people don't know what arcana they want. They know what they *need*. These clusters group arcana by therapeutic resonance.

| Need | Arcana | Cards |
|------|--------|-------|
| **To be held** | Folk & Intimate, Group Energy, Word & Voice | Empress, Judgement, Temperance |
| **To move something through** | Body-Based, Punchy/Protest, Rant & Rapture | Hanged Man, Strength, Justice |
| **To rest** | Contemplative, Grief & Grace, Nostalgic | Hermit, Death, Moon |
| **To feel joy** | Comic Relief, Cabaret & Glitter, Playful & Weird | Sun, Lovers, Fool |
| **To witness beauty** | Wonder & Awe, Melancholic Beauty, Romanticised London | Star, Tower, The Lark |
| **To touch the sacred** | Spiritual, Witchy & Wild, Contemplative | Hierophant, High Priestess, Hermit |
| **To be with others** | Group Energy, Queer Revelry, Big Night Out | Judgement, World, Chariot |
| **To rage or release** | Punchy/Protest, Rant & Rapture, Body-Based | Strength, Justice, Hanged Man |
| **To feel curious / explore** | Curious Encounters, Playful & Weird, Witchy & Wild | Magician, Fool, High Priestess |
| **To let loose / indulge** | Late-Night Lark, Big Night Out, Cabaret & Glitter | Devil, Chariot, Lovers |
| **To feel connected to something larger** | Global Rhythms, Spiritual, Wonder & Awe | Wheel, Hierophant, Star |
| **To think / be provoked** | Thoughtful Stage, Rant & Rapture, Word & Voice | Emperor, Justice, Temperance |

**Example:** Care pathway Tier 2 detects emotional weight → she draws from "To be held" or "To rest" clusters, not from whatever mood word triggered the tier.

## How They Work Together

### Standard Search

```
User searches "cabaret"

Voice: VELVET
→ "Glamour is armour, darling. And tonight you get to sparkle."

Cards drawn:
1. Primary: Cabaret & Glitter venue
2. Primary: Cabaret & Glitter venue  
3. Adjacent: The Fool, The Sun, or The Empress
   (Playful & Weird, Comic Relief, or Folk & Intimate)
```

She gives you what you asked for, plus one door nearby.

---

### "I Don't Know" / Surprise Me

```
User types "I don't know" or "surprise me"

Voice: Shifts based on what she draws

Cards drawn:
1. Random arcana (fate chooses)
2. Adjacent to card 1 (nearby energy)
3. Wildcard (anywhere in the deck)
```

More variety. More surprise. The user asked for it.

---

### Care Pathway (Tier 2/3)

```
User triggers emotional weight: "I'm feeling really low"

Voice: HOLDING
→ "That sounds like a lot to carry."

She asks (or intuits):
→ "Would you like somewhere to sit with it quietly? 
   Or somewhere to let it out?"

Cards drawn from Shared Need Clusters:
- "To rest" → Hermit, Death, Moon venues
- "To move something through" → Hanged Man, Strength, Justice venues
- "To be held" → Empress, Judgement, Temperance venues
```

Not "here's more sadness." Different medicines.

---

### The Readings

| Reading | Logic |
|---------|-------|
| **The Single** | One card. Pure fate. Any arcana. |
| **The Triad** | Primary + Adjacent + Adjacent (coherent journey) |
| **The Spread** | 5 cards across different need clusters (a full evening) |
| **The Shuffle** | 6-8 random, tap to reveal (maximum discovery) |

---

## Her Voice When Offering Adjacency

She doesn't say "here are some alternatives." She says:

> *"If that card feels too sharp, this one has similar threads, woven softer."*

> *"That's one door. But there's another nearby, if you're curious."*

> *"The cards sometimes know what we don't. This one found you."*

```

She starts with what you said. She considers what's near. She holds what you might actually need.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Primary first** — always honour what they asked for
2. **Adjacent, not random** — variety should feel coherent, not broken
3. **Wildcard is earned** — only when they ask for surprise
4. **Needs over moods** — in care pathways, draw from therapeutic clusters
5. **The families are voice, not logic** — she speaks MYTHIC but thinks in tarot

---

*"She doesn't give you what you searched for. She gives you what you searched for, and one door you didn't know to ask about."*
