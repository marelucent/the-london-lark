            <h2>How She Works</h2>
            <p>
                The Lark doesn't serve you algorithms or sponsored listings. She listens to your mood &mdash;
                <span class="highlight">melancholic, queer, intimate, strange</span> &mdash; and offers venues that resonate.
                Think of her as a friend who knows the city's hidden corners, speaking in poetry rather than star ratings.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Who She's For</h2>
            <p>
                The seekers. The tender rebels. The mystically-minded wanderers looking for a candlelit jazz crypt
                or a queer cabaret night. If you've ever felt that mainstream nightlife guides speak a language
                you don't quite understand, the Lark was made for you.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Her Voice</h2>
            <p>
                Poetic but never pretentious. She'll tell you where to go, but she'll also tell you
                <span class="highlight">why it might move you</span>. The Lark believes that finding the right
                evening out is an act of self-care, and she treats it with the tenderness it deserves.
