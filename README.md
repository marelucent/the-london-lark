# 🕊️ The London Lark

A poetic, personalised cultural companion for London life.

The Lark helps users discover soulful, character-rich events — from fringe theatre to folk gigs, queer cabaret to poetic talks — using mood-matching rather than algorithms.

It interprets natural language prompts like:

- "Take me somewhere candlelit and strange this Friday"
- "Any feminist gigs in Camden tomorrow night?"
- "Surprise me with something I wouldn’t normally pick"

…and returns 1–3 lyrical event suggestions drawn from London’s rich cultural undercurrent.

## 🌿 Core Components

- `prompt_parser.py`: Extracts filters from user language (mood, date, location, etc.)
- `mood_index.json`: A living list of moods + synonyms
- `venue_profiles.md`: Poetic venue vibes, tagged with mood fits
- `poetic_templates.md`: Response templates per mood
- `prompt_tests.md`: Examples to simulate user–Lark interactions

## 🎯 MVP Goal

One natural-language prompt → three mood-matched, poetic cultural suggestions → joy.
