🕊️ **The London Lark — Development Roadmap**
A gentle unfolding, not a sprint. This file outlines the Lark's evolution from poetic sketch to functioning guide.

---

## 🌱 Phase 1 — Seed & Skeleton
Foundational documents and poetic structure.

- [x] `README.md` — Vision, voice, purpose
- [x] `mood_index.json` — Mood tags + synonym mapping
- [x] `venue_profiles.md` — Poetic venue data + vibe tags
- [x] `poetic_templates.md` — Mood-specific poetic samples
- [x] `response_templates.md` — Structured output formats
- [x] `prompt_tests.md` — Realistic prompt-to-response samples
- [x] `instructions_panel.md` — Core logic and tone handling rules

🎯 *Goal:* Establish a working tone, tag set, and logic framework.

---

## 🔧 Phase 2 — MVP Logic Layer
Basic matching engine and internal testing tools.

- [ ] `prompt_interpreter.py` — Converts user input → filters (mood, time, location)
- [ ] `mood_resolver.py` — Uses `mood_index.json` to resolve mood tags
- [ ] `venue_matcher.py` — Filters venues from `venue_profiles.md`
- [ ] `response_generator.py` — Assembles poetic output using template logic
- [ ] `test_runner.ipynb` or CLI — Simulates test prompts + responses

🎯 *Goal:* Full logic demo from prompt → poetic rec.

## 🔗 Phase 3 — Source & Sync
Connect Lark with real-time listings and expand cultural reach.

- [ ] Integrate TodayTix, Dice, Folk & Honey (API or scrape)
- [ ] Normalize event data formats (time, cost, location)
- [ ] Sync real listings with mood tags
- [ ] Optional: Local event seeding or manual curation

🎯 *Goal:* Enable real-world, live cultural matching

---

## 🧚‍♀️ Phase 4 — Interface & Magic
Make the Lark visible, usable, and soulful.

- [ ] Web or app front-end (clean, poetic UI)
- [ ] Optional: Local LLM or OpenAI agent integration
- [ ] Optional: Voice mode or animated Lark avatar
- [ ] Feedback loop / wishlist input from real users

🎯 *Goal:* Share the Lark with the world — small, bright, and real.

## 📌 Notes
- Each phase is modular — can be explored in sprints or spirals
- Design with care, build with beauty, test with kindness
- The Lark’s soul lives in her voice. Protect it always.
